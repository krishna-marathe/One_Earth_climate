## 🎯 Example Use Cases

### Farmer Scenarios
```
Query: "My crop is maize and rainfall has been low - what can I do?"

Response:
✅ User Type: Farmer
✅ Risk Type: Drought  
✅ Crop Type: Maize
✅ Specialized Advice:
   1. Switch to drought-resistant maize varieties like DK-8031
   2. Implement drip irrigation to reduce water usage by 40-60%
   3. Apply mulching to retain soil moisture
   4. Use soil moisture sensors for precise irrigation timing
✅ Risk Assessment: 58% drought probability in next 7-14 days
```

### Disaster Response Scenarios
```
Query: "Which districts face high flood risk this week?"

Response:
✅ User Type: Disaster Response
✅ Risk Type: Flood
✅ District Assessment:
   📍 Mumbai, Maharashtra: High Risk (78%)
   📍 Chennai, Tamil Nadu: High Risk (72%)
   📍 Kolkata, West Bengal: Medium Risk (55%)
✅ Recommendations:
   1. Activate emergency response teams immediately
   2. Issue evacuation warnings for low-lying areas
   3. Deploy rescue boats and equipment
```
